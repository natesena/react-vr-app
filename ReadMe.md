### What does this app do?
Currently, this app allows users to post messages on others' walls in a VR environment. This allows users to travel to search for messages left by friends or strangers in their own virtual world.
In the future, this idea can be expanded to allow people to explore their relationships with others through 3d space, or to allow users to curate 3d environments as they would a store, home, or far-off universe.

### Areas of Future Focus
- Firstly, I want to focus on making a login view separate from the sign up view, where JWT tokens are recognized
- Some edits need to be made to the Password Inputs so that they are not easy to see
- My solution for working around the lack of browser history should both hijack the browser url and forward, back history calls
- Inputs for VR Text Coordinates should be more strict
- Adding ability to work with copy/paste to handle links
- Adding mobility to each scene
- allowing users to upload more models, images, etc.
- Allowing users to change the pano of each scene
